# Flash In The Dark

This game is my entry to the Duck Sauce Games 2024 Game Jam. The theme for this jam was Discovery. The game is built in the Godot Engine.

This game is a 2D platformer, in which you are trapped in a dark room and need to escape. Flashing your light lets you discover hidden clues to reveal the way out.
